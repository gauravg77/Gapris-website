This project is a custom e-commerce platform for selling my hyperrealism artwork, featuring an admin interface for managing inventory and transactions, while customers can browse the gallery, view detailed images and descriptions, add items to their cart, and securely complete purchases using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.
